OpenApp Coding Challenge

README:
Projects provided as per instructions using base code.

Part One utilizes the python modules CSV and RE which may need to be installed via pip before attempting to run code.

In Part Two, I decided to add a check for non-int numbers or non-digits. Floats, chars, and strings return 'Invalid'. I added two tests to verify. I left in prints in the test as I generally prefer to get some visual feedback when I run code/tests.

The code runs for me prior to a push to git. If you encounter any
errors, please let me know.

My normal approach would be to write these as classes, and use unittest or nosetest and Mock where applicable for tests.

I did not run these against PEP or pylint, so there could be a few gigs (long lines, extra white space, etc.).

Thanks again for the opportunity.

Kind regards,

Patrick Collins
